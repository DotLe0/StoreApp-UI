# StoreApp-UI
This is a simple store app for gaming. It doesn't use date base so it's not the best.  

Just navegate thrugh the manus and chose the items you want then go to CARD and buy them.

For first name and second name the names must be at least 3 letters long.
For card number 16 or more numbers.
For cvv 3 numbers
and for adress 1 letter will be fine.
